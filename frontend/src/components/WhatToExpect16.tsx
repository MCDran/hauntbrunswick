                <p>
                For the bravest souls, our 16+ night is where we pull out all the stops. Expect
                a more intense experience, with bloodier visuals, jump scares, and a terrifying
                atmosphere designed to make you scream.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Darker Themes with unsettling, creepy settings.</li>
                <li>Jump Scares and Startles from actors ready to surprise you.</li>
                <li>Close Encountersâ€”actors may get close, and static props may brush against you.</li>
                <li>Scarier Sound Effects with unnerving noises that make you feel watched</li>
                <li>Disturbing Props including dead bodies, organs, and grotesque scenes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This night is recommended for ages 16 and up due to the graphic content.</p>
